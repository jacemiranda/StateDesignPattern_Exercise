# Bank Account Management System
### *State Design Pattern Exercise*

A bank needs to manage different states of customer accounts, including active, suspended, and closed. Each state has specific rules and restrictions regarding allowed operations, and accounts have associated attributes like account number and balance.

**Active**, you can move to **Suspended** or **Closed**
